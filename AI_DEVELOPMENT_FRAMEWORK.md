# AI-Assisted Development Framework

## Overview
This framework establishes a systematic approach to AI-assisted software development, optimizing for collaboration between human developers and AI models while maintaining code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Plan-First Development**
- Always begin with comprehensive planning before implementation
- Plans serve as contracts between human and AI
- Iterative refinement ensures alignment before execution
- Include risk assessment and success metrics upfront

### 2. **Isolated Development**
- Each feature/fix developed in dedicated branches
- Prevents pollution of main branch
- Enables clean rollback if needed
- Maintain feature flags for gradual rollout

### 3. **Test-Driven Validation**
- Define test scenarios during planning phase
- Tests created after implementation to validate requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage with performance benchmarks
- Creates regression safety net

### 4. **Multi-AI Review**
- Claude for complex reasoning and implementation
- GitHub Copilot for code review
- Specialized tools for security and performance
- Cross-validation between AI models catches different issues

### 5. **Continuous Improvement**
- Collect metrics on every iteration
- Regular retrospectives and framework updates
- Documentation as code philosophy
- Feedback loops at every phase

## Enhanced Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Planning & Context Setup

#### 1. **Context Preparation**
   - Create/Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with:
     - Tech stack details
     - Architecture decisions  
     - Coding conventions
     - Common patterns used
   - Review existing ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
   - Identify relevant prompt templates

#### 2. **Request Detailed Plan**
   - Use prompt templates for consistency
   - Ask Claude for comprehensive implementation plan including:
     - Objective and scope
     - Step-by-step implementation approach
     - Acceptance criteria and success metrics
     - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
     - Time estimates per step
     - Dependencies and prerequisites
     - Test scenarios and coverage targets
     - Performance benchmarks

#### 3. **Plan Documentation**
   - Save as `PLAN_<DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>.md`
   - Automatically gitignored to keep repository clean
   - Include test plan with coverage targets
   - Document architectural decisions as ADRs
   - Define measurable success criteria

#### 4. **Plan Refinement**
   - Discuss and iterate on plan with Claude
   - Clarify ambiguities
   - Add missing requirements
   - Validate time estimates
   - Consider performance implications
   - Review risk mitigation strategies
   - Finalize test scenarios

### Phase 2: Implementation with Quality Gates

#### 5. **Pre-Implementation Setup**
   - Configure pre-commit hooks:
     - Linting (ESLint, Ruff, Clippy)
     - Format checking (Prettier, Black, Rustfmt)
     - Basic security scanning
   - Set up PR template
   - Verify CI/CD pipeline configuration

#### 6. **Branch Creation**
   - Create feature branch: `feature/<task-name>`
   - Or bugfix branch: `fix/<issue-name>`
   - Or refactor branch: `refactor/<component-name>`
   - Keep branch names descriptive but concise

#### 7. **Incremental Development**
   - Implement plan step-by-step
   - Follow code complexity limits:
     - Functions < 50 lines
     - Cyclomatic complexity < 10
     - Clear, descriptive naming
   - Specialized agent coordination:
     - implementation-engineer: Complex logic, architecture
     - test-specialist: Test creation and validation
     - quality-guardian: Continuous quality monitoring
   - Commit frequently with semantic messages:
     - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
     - Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, perf
   - Keep each commit atomic and reversible

#### 8. **Documentation During Development**
   - Write inline documentation (JSDoc/PyDoc)
   - Update README.md for new features
   - Create/Update ADRs for architectural changes
   - Document API changes comprehensively
   - Add examples for complex features

#### 9. **Test Creation & Validation**
   - Write comprehensive tests covering:
     - Unit tests for business logic
     - Integration tests for APIs
     - Edge cases and error conditions
     - Performance benchmarks for critical paths
   - Ensure minimum 80% coverage
   - Run full test suite
   - Validate against success metrics from plan

#### 10. **Quality Checks**
   - Run linting: `npm run lint` / `ruff check`
   - Run type checking: `npm run typecheck` / `mypy`
   - Run security scanning
   - Check performance benchmarks:
     - API response < 200ms (95th percentile)
     - Page load < 3 seconds
   - Verify no regression in existing tests

### Phase 3: Review, Integration & Feedback

#### 11. **Push to Remote & CI/CD**
   - Push branch to remote repository
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes:
     - Automated tests
     - Code coverage reporting
     - Security vulnerability scanning
     - Performance benchmarks
   - Monitor build time (< 5 minutes target)

#### 12. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Use PR template with:
     - Link to original PLAN_*.md
     - Summary of changes
     - Test results and coverage report
     - Performance impact analysis
     - Breaking changes highlighted
     - Migration guide if needed

## Best Practices for Human-AI Readability

### For Humans
1. **Clear Structure**: Consistent file organization with obvious entry points
2. **Meaningful Names**: Self-documenting variables, functions, and files
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Strategic whitespace and formatting
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple API, complex implementation
5. **Example-Driven**: Include usage examples in documentation

### For AI Models
1. **Explicit Context**: Never assume AI remembers previous conversations
2. **Complete Examples**: Provide full code samples with imports
3. **Type Annotations**: Use TypeScript/Python type hints everywhere
4. **Pattern Consistency**: Use same patterns throughout codebase
5. **Business Logic Comments**: Explain why, not what
6. **File Path References**: Include file_path:line_number format
