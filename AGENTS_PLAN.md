# AI Development Framework: Agent-Based Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic migration from the current manual 18-step framework to a Claude Code sub-agent orchestrated approach. The migration leverages Claude Code's sub-agent capabilities to automate and orchestrate development workflows while maintaining the framework's core principles and quality standards.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Framework Structure
- **18-step manual workflow** across 4 phases
- **Manual TodoWrite management** for task tracking
- **Human-driven quality gates** and validation
- **Configuration via ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** (symlinked to dotfiles)
- **Rich documentation set**: README, framework docs, quick reference, ADRs

### Key Strengths to Preserve
- Systematic approach with clear phases
- Comprehensive quality standards (functions <50 lines, coverage >80%)
- Semantic commit messages and git workflow integration
- Project-specific adaptations (JS/TS, Python, Rust)
- Metrics collection and retrospective processes

### Pain Points to Address
- **Manual coordination** between steps
- **Context switching** between different types of tasks
- **Repetitive quality checks** across projects
- **Inconsistent execution** of framework steps
- **Limited scalability** for complex multi-component features

### Updated ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md Configuration

```markdown
# AI Development Framework Configuration v2.1 - Agent-Enhanced

## Agent-Based Workflow Activation

### Primary Agent: framework-orchestrator
- **Trigger**: Any development task requiring >3 steps
- **Purpose**: Master coordinator for 18-step workflow
- **Delegation**: Automatically delegates to specialized agents

### Agent Hierarchy
1. **framework-orchestrator** (master coordinator)
2. **context-analyst** (Phase 1: context and project analysis)
3. **plan-architect** (Phase 1: planning and architecture)
4. **implementation-engineer** (Phase 2: code implementation)
5. **test-specialist** (Phase 2: testing and validation)
6. **quality-guardian** (Phase 2-3: quality assurance)
7. **review-coordinator** (Phase 3: PR and review management)
8. **metrics-collector** (Phase 4: metrics and retrospectives)

### Agent Coordination Rules
- Only framework-orchestrator can initiate TodoWrite workflows
- Each specialist agent reports back to orchestrator
