## Template for Future Releases

## [3.0.0] - 2025-09-04

### Added
- **Claude Code Sub-Agent Orchestration**: Complete automation of 18-step workflow through 8 specialized agents
- **Agent Hierarchy**: 
  - framework-orchestrator (master coordinator)
  - context-analyst (project analysis and tech stack detection)
  - plan-architect (comprehensive planning and architecture)
  - implementation-engineer (code implementation with quality standards)
  - test-specialist (testing and validation with 80% coverage)
  - quality-guardian (quality assurance and performance monitoring)
  - review-coordinator (PR management and review coordination)
  - metrics-collector (data collection and retrospective insights)
- **Go Language Support**: Added alongside JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust
- **Agent Samples**: Complete agent configurations in `/agents` folder
- **Enhanced GitIgnore**: Comprehensive *PLAN* file exclusion patterns

### Changed
- **Workflow Automation**: From manual TodoWrite to fully automated agent coordination
- **Performance Targets**: 
  - Planning time: 15-30min → 5-15min (automated analysis)
  - Implementation time: 2 hours → 1-1.5 hours (focused specialist work)  
  - Review cycles: 3 iterations → 1-2 iterations (higher initial quality)
  - Quality checks: 15-20min → 5min (automated execution)
- **User Interaction**: Simple task description triggers complete automated workflow
- **Framework Coordination**: Agent-to-agent communication replaces human coordination

### Enhanced
- **CLAUDE_CONFIGURATION_SAMPLE.md**: Added agent usage instructions and coordination workflows
- **README.md**: Updated for agent-enhanced approach with practical usage examples
- **AI_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md**: Integrated agent-specific workflow automation
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Added agent automation timing and coordination details

### Improved
- **Agent Specialization**: Each phase handled by dedicated expert agents
- **Quality Enforcement**: Continuous monitoring through quality-guardian agent
- **Context Analysis**: Automated project structure and tech stack detection
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated by implementation-engineer during development
- **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive data gathering for continuous improvement

### Fixed
- **Workflow Bottlenecks**: Eliminated manual coordination delays through agent orchestration
- **Quality Consistency**: Standardized quality enforcement across all projects
- **Context Switching**: Reduced cognitive load through specialized agent delegation
- **Planning Overhead**: Automated comprehensive planning reduces setup time
